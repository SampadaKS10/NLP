The Information Technology Act 2000 and the I.T. Amendment Act 2008 have been dealt \\nwith in detail and other legislations dealing with electronic offences have been discussed in brief.',\n",
       " 'Introduction:',\n",
       " 'Crime is both a social and economic phenomenon. It is as old as human society. Many ancient \\nbooks  right  from  pre-historic  days,  and  mythological  stories  have  spoken  about  crimes \\ncommitted  by  individuals  be  it  against  another individual  like  ordinary  theft  and  burglary  or \\nagainst  the  nation  like  spying,  treason  etc.  Kautilya’s  Arthashastra  written  around  350  BC, \\nconsidered  to  be  an  authentic  administrative  treatise  in  India,  discusses  the  various  crimes, \\nsecurity initiatives to be taken by the rulers, possible crimes in a state etc. and also advocates \\npunishment for the list of some stipulated offences. Different kinds of punishments have been \\nprescribed for listed offences and the concept of restoration of loss to the victims has also been \\ndiscussed in it.',\n",
       " 'Crime in any form adversely affects all the members of the society. In developing economies, cyber \\ncrime  has  increased  at  rapid  strides,  due  to  the  rapid  diffusion  of  the  Internet  and  the  digitisation  of \\neconomic activities. Thanks to the huge penetration of technology in almost all walks of society right \\nfrom  corporate  governance  and  state  administration,  up  to  the  lowest  level  of  petty  shop  keepers \\ncomputerizing  their  billing  system,  we  find  computers  and  other  electronic  devices  pervading  the \\nhuman  life.  The  penetration  is  so  deep that  man  cannot  spend  a  day  without computers  or a  mobile. \\nSnatching some one’s mobile will tantamount to dumping one in solitary confinement!',\n",
       " 'Cyber Crime is not defined in Information Technology Act 2000 nor in the I.T. Amendment Act 2008 \\nnor  in  any  other  legislation  in  India.  In  fact,  it  cannot  be  too.  Offence  or  crime  has  been  dealt  with \\nelaborately listing various acts and the punishments for each, under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and \\nquite a few other legislations too. Hence, to define cyber crime, we can say, it is just a combination of \\ncrime and computer. To put it in simple terms ‘any offence or crime in which a computer is used is a \\ncyber crime’. Interestingly even a petty offence like stealing or pick-pocket can be brought within the \\nbroader  purview  of  cyber  crime  if  the  basic  data  or  aid  to  such  an  offence  is  a  computer  or  an \\ninformation stored in a computer used (or misused) by the fraudster. The I.T. Act defines a computer, \\ncomputer network, data, information and all other necessary ingredients that form part of a cyber crime, \\nabout which we will now be discussing in detail.',\n",

       " 'The Genesis of IT legislation in India: Mid 90’s saw an impetus in globalization and computerisation, \\nwith  more  and  more  nations  computerizing  their  governance,  and  e-commerce  seeing  an  enormous \\ngrowth.  Until  then,  most  of  international  trade  and  transactions  were  done  through  documents  being \\ntransmitted  through  post  and  by  telex  only.      Evidences  and  records,  until  then,  were  predominantly \\npaper evidences and paper records or other forms of hard-copies only. With much of international trade \\nbeing  done  through  electronic  communication  and  with  email  gaining  momentum,  an  urgent  and \\nimminent need was felt for recognizing electronic records ie the data what is stored in a computer or an \\nexternal storage attached thereto.',\n",

The  General  Assembly  of  United  Nations  passed  a  resolution  in January  1997 \\ninter alia, recommending all States in the UN to give favourable considerations to the said Model Law, \\nwhich provides for recognition to electronic records and according it the same treatment like a paper \\ncommunication and record.',\n",

Similarly \\nSatellite phones were used in the Mumbai attack case in November 2008 after which the investigators \\nbecame  aware  of  the  technological  perils  of such  gadgets,  since  until  then, they  were relying  on  cell \\nphones  and  the  directional  tracking  by  the  cell  phone  towers  and  Call  Details  Register  entries  only. \\nHopefully, more and more awareness campaign will take place and the government will be conscious of \\nthe path ahead to bring more and more legislations in place. Actually, bringing more legislations may \\njust not be sufficient, because the conviction rate in Cyber crime offences is among the lowest in the \\nnation, much lower than the rate in IPC and other offences. The government should be aware that it is \\nnot the severity of punishment that is a deterrent for the criminals, but it is the certainty of punishment. \\nIt  is  not  the  number  of  legislations  in  a  society  that  should  prevent  crimes  but  it  is  the  certainty  of \\npunishment that the legislation will bring.',\n",

       " 'Prevention of Money Laundering Act:',\n",
       " 'Black money has always been a serious evil in any developing economy. Nation builders, lawmakers \\nand particularly the country’s financial administrators have always taken persistent efforts to curb the \\nevil of black money and all sorts of illegally earned income. A major initiative taken in this direction in \\nIndia  is  the  Anti  Money  Laundering  Act  2002.  A  main  objective  of  the  Act  was  to  provide  for \\nconfiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering.',\n",
       " 'Money  laundering  though  not  defined  in  the  Act,  can  be  construed  to  mean  directly  or  indirectly \\nattempting to indulge in any process or activity connected with the proceeds  of crime and projecting it \\nas untainted property.  The Act stipulates that whoever commits the offence of money laundering shall \\nbe punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but may \\nextend to seven years and also be liable to a fine which may extend to five lakh rupees.',\n",
       " 'Money laundering involves a process of getting the money from illegal sources, layering it in any legal \\nsource, integrating it as part of any legal system like banking and actually using it. Since the banking as',\n",
       " '17',\n",
       " 'an industry has a major and significant role to play in the act of money laundering, it is now a serious \\nresponsibility on the part of banks to ensure that banking channel is not used in the criminal activity. \\nMuch more than a responsibility, it is now a compliance issue as well.',\n",
       " 'Obligations  of  banks  include  maintenance  of  records  of  all  transactions  of  the  nature  and  value \\nspecified  in  the  rules,  furnish  information  of  the  transactions  within  the  prescribed  time,  whenever \\nwarranted  and  verify  and  maintain  records  of  the  identity  of  all  customers.  Hence,  as  a  corollary, \\nadherence to Know Your Customer norms and maintenance of all KYC records assumes a very major \\nsignificance and becomes a compliance issue. Records of cash transactions and suspicious transactions \\nare to be kept and reported as stipulated.  Non compliance on any of these will render the concerned \\nbank official liable for the offence of money laundering and guilty under the Act.',\n",
       " 'e-Records Maintenance Policy of Banks:',\n",
       " 'Computerisation started in most of the banks in India from end 80’s in a small way in the form of stand- \\nalone  systems  called  Advanced  Ledger  Posting  Machines  (Separate  PC  for  every  counter/activity) \\nwhich then led to the era of Total Branch Automation or Computerisation in early or mid 90’s. TBA or \\nTBC  as it  was  popularly  called,  marked  the  beginning  of  a  networked  environment  on  a  Local  Area \\nNetwork under a client-server architecture when records used to be maintained in electronic manner in \\nhard-disks and external media like tapes etc for backup purposes.',\n",
       " 'Ever  since  passing  of  the  ITA  and  according  of  recognition  to  electronic  records,  it  has  become \\nmandatory  on  the  part  of  banks  to  maintain  proper  computerized  system  for  electronic  records. \\nConventionally, all legacy systems in the banks always do have a record maintenance policy often with \\nRBI’s and their individual Board approval stipulating the period of preservation for all sorts of records, \\nledgers, vouchers, register, letters, documents etc.',\n",
       " 'Thanks  to  computerisation  and  introduction  of  computerized  data  maintenance  and  often  computer- \\ngenerated  vouchers  also, most  of  the  banks  became  responsive  to the  computerized environment  and \\nquite a few have started the process of formulating their own Electronic Records Maintenance Policy. \\nIndian Banks’ Association took the initiative in bringing out a book on Banks’ e-Records Maintenance \\nPolicy to serve as a model for use and adoption in banks suiting the individual bank’s technological set- \\nup. Hence banks should ensure that e-records maintenance policy with details of e-records, their nature, \\ntheir  upkeep,  the  technological  requirements,  off-site  backup,  retrieval  systems,  access  control  and \\naccess privileges initiatives should be in place, if not already done already.',\n",
       " 'On the legal compliance side especially after the Rules were passed in April 2011, on the “Reasonable \\nSecurity  Practices  and  Procedures”  as  part  of  ITAA  2008  Section  43A,  banks  should  strive  well  to \\nprove that they have all the security policies in place like compliance with ISO 27001 standards etc and \\ne-records  are  maintained.  Besides,  the  certificate  to  be  given  as  an  annexure  to  e-evidences  as \\nstipulated in the BBE Act also emphasizes this point of maintenance of e-records in a proper ensuring \\nproper  backup,  ensuring  against  tamperability,  always  ensuring  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability \\nand Non Repudiation.',\n",
       " 'This policy should not be confused with the Information Technology Business Continuity and Disaster \\nRecovery Plan or Policy nor the Data Warehousing initiatives. Focus on all these three policies (BC- \\nDRP, DWH and E-records Maintenance Policy) are individually different, serving different purposes, \\nusing  different  technologies  and  maybe  coming  under  different  administrative  controls  too  at  the \\nmanagerial level.',\n",

Data \\nCommunication,  storage,  child  pornography,  electronic  records  and  data  privacy  have  all  been \\naddressed in separate Acts and Rules giving thrust in the particular area focused in the Act.',\n",

       " 'Conclusion:  To  sum  up,  though  a  crime-free  society  is  Utopian  and  exists  only  in  dream- \\nland,  it  should  be  constant  endeavour  of  rules  to  keep  the  crimes  lowest.      Especially  in  a \\nsociety that is dependent more and more on technology, crime based on electronic offences are \\nbound to increase and the law makers have to go the extra mile compared to the fraudsters, to \\nkeep them at bay. Technology is always a double-edged sword and can be used for both the \\npurposes – good or bad. Steganography, Trojan Horse, Scavenging (and even DoS or DDoS) \\nare  all  technologies  and  per  se  not  crimes,  but  falling  into  the  wrong  hands  with  a  criminal \\nintent who are out to capitalize them or misuse them, they come into the gamut of cyber crime \\nand  become punishable  offences.
